Refine and enhance the Squid Game hackathon frontend to feel EVEN MORE AUTHENTIC
to the Squid Game Netflix series. Increase cinematic realism, improve symbol usage,
and add strong Squid Game visual identity across ALL pages and rounds.

--------------------------------------------------
CRITICAL FIX: CIRCLE / TRIANGLE / SQUARE SYMBOLS

DO NOT use flat emoji-style ◯ △ ⬜ icons.

INSTEAD:
- Use MASKED GUARDS wearing:
  - Circle mask
  - Triangle mask
  - Square mask
- Symbols should appear ONLY:
  - On guard masks
  - As subtle wall markings
  - As embossed UI elements
- No floating geometric shapes without context

SYMBOL DESIGN RULES:
- Metallic / matte texture
- Low opacity
- Slight red glow
- Positioned like real Squid Game set design

--------------------------------------------------
GLOBAL VISUAL IMMERSION UPGRADE

Add Squid Game–inspired IMAGES across the site:
- Masked guards standing still in shadows
- Guards holding rifles in elimination screens
- Doll image only appears during Red Light events
- Arena shots for team battles
- Control room visuals for Broken Code Fix
- Underground bunker visuals for Morse round

Images must be:
- Darkened
- Slightly blurred
- Cinematic
- NOT cartoonish
- NOT bright
