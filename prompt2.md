Extend the existing Squid Game hackathon frontend by adding a FULL CINEMATIC LANDING PAGE
and DEMO / EXAMPLE VERSIONS of ALL 4 ROUNDS.
The experience must feel like entering the Squid Game universe.

--------------------------------------------------
LANDING PAGE (VERY IMPORTANT)

Design a FULLSCREEN landing page inspired directly by Squid Game.

BACKGROUND:
- Dark, cinematic background
- Faded playground image
- Masked guards silhouettes (circle, triangle, square)
- Subtle grain/noise overlay
- Slow ambient motion (fog or light flicker)

TOP CENTER TEXT (Game Of Squids font):
"ONE HACKATHON
MULTIPLE THRILLERS"

SUBTEXT:
"SQUID GAME HACKATHON"

TAGLINE (smaller, red):
"Code. Conquer. Win."

CENTER ELEMENT:
- Large glowing Squid Game shapes (◯ △ ⬜)
- Shapes slowly pulse red

BUTTONS (centered vertically):
- ENTER THE GAME
- VIEW ROUNDS
- REGISTER

BUTTON STYLE:
- Black background
- Red border
- Red glow on hover
- Slight shake animation on hover

FOOTER TEXT:
"DEPARTMENT OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES — EMERGIANS PRESENTS"

--------------------------------------------------
NAVIGATION FLOW:

Each card:
- Squid Game font title

--------------------------------------------------
DEMO ROUND 1: RED LIGHT — GREEN LIGHT (MOST IMPORTANT)

This must be CINEMATIC and ACCURATE to Squid Game.

BACKGROUND:
- Dark playground
- Full Squid Game doll image at the far end (initially hidden)

TOP CENTER:
- BIG CIRCLE INDICATOR
- Starts GREEN

RANDOM TIMER LOGIC (VISUAL SIMULATION):
- Random countdown appears (2–4 seconds)
- Timer text appears briefly:
  "3… 2… 1…"

RED LIGHT EVENT:
- Screen suddenly BLINKS RED
- Loud stop sound placeholder
- Doll image suddenly appears and zooms slightly
- Circle turns RED
- Code editor visually locks
- Screen shakes slightly

GREEN LIGHT EVENT:
- Circle turns GREEN
- Doll fades back into darkness
- Typing re-enabled

DEMO CODE:
- Simple example problem:
  "Print Hello Squid Game"
- Typing during red shows warning animation
- Demo elimination screen:

"PLAYER 067 ELIMINATED"

--------------------------------------------------
DEMO ROUND 2: BROKEN CODE FIX

BACKGROUND:
- Dark control room image

EXAMPLE PROBLEM:
- Broken code shown on left:
  Missing loop / wrong condition
- Right side editable demo code

HEADER TEXT:
"ONE SUBMISSION.
NO MERCY."

DEMO SUBMISSION:
- Clicking submit shows:
  "FINAL SUBMISSION LOCKED"
- Red screen fade

--------------------------------------------------
DEMO ROUND 3: WAR OF CODE (RED vs BLUE)

BACKGROUND:
- Dark arena
- Rope across center

EXAMPLE:

- Fake live updates:
  "RED TEAM +1"
  "BLUE TEAM +1"

ROPE ANIMATION:
- Rope shifts slightly based on fake progress

RESULT DEMO:
- Red team wins
- Blue side fades out with:
  "ELIMINATED"

--------------------------------------------------
DEMO ROUND 4: MORSE CODING

BACKGROUND:
- Terminal-style dark screen
- Blinking cursor

EXAMPLE MORSE:
"... --- ..."

DECODE STEP:
- User enters "SOS"
- Screen flickers
- Access granted animation

PROBLEM UNLOCK:
- Example problem appears:
  "Count number of characters"

SUBMISSION CONFIRMATION:
" MESSAGE ACCEPTED "

--------------------------------------------------
COMMON DEMO RULES:
- These are DEMO / PREVIEW modes
- No real evaluation
- Used to explain gameplay before event
- All animations must be slow, cinematic, tense

--------------------------------------------------
STRICT VISUAL RULES:
- Use Game Of Squids font for all headings
- Blood red (#D62828), black (#0B0B0B) only
- No bright colors
- No emojis
- No playful UI

--------------------------------------------------
DESIGN INTENT:
This landing page and demo rounds should feel
like the Squid Game trailer — slow, dark, scary,
and immersive — not like a hackathon website.
